* **Part 2 developer and tutor:** Dr. Olga D. Khon, PhD in Finance
* **Level:** Postgraduate level

I was appointed to develop and deliver the second  half of a new module titled “Contemporary Topics in Digital Finance” on the postgraduate level. I did this job by myself, given my knowledge and industry experience, with no help provided (though I wasn't  a module leader).
